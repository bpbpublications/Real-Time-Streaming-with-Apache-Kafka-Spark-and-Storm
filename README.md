# Real-Time Streaming with Apache Kafka, Spark, and Storm

Create Platforms That Can Quickly Crunch Data and Deliver Real-Time Analytics to Users

This is the repository for [Real-Time Streaming with Apache Kafka, Spark, and Storm](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/real-time-streaming-with-apache-kafka-spark-and-storm?_pos=1&_sid=6ed72fb9e&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
Real-Time Streaming with Apache Kafka, Spark, and Storm is a book that provides an overview of the real-time streaming concepts and architectures of Apache Kafka, Storm, and Spark. The readers will learn how to build systems that can process data streams in real time using these technologies. They will be able to process a large amount of real-time data and perform analytics or generate insights as a result of this.

The architecture of Kafka and its various components are described in detail. A Kafka Cluster installation and configuration will be demonstrated. The Kafka publisher-subscriber system will be implemented in the Eclipse IDE using the Command Line and Java. The book discusses the architecture of Apache Storm, the concepts of Spout and Bolt, as well as their applications in a Transaction Alert System. It also describes Spark's core concepts, applications, and the use of Spark to implement a microservice. To learn about the process of integrating Kafka and Storm, two approaches to Spark and Kafka integration will be discussed.

This book will assist a software engineer to transition to a Big Data engineer and Big Data architect by providing knowledge of big data processing and the architectures of Kafka, Storm, and Spark Streaming.
